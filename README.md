**ðŸ“‹ Guidelines:**
---

- **Important Note:** The list of subdomains provided is unfiltered. It may include both legitimate subdomains and domains with similar names (e.g., `dell.com`, `prm.dell.com`, `lynnebardell.com`, `cpanel.chrisdell.com`).

- **Wildcard Subdomains Policy:**  
  - If your organization allows all domains, no action is required on your part.
  - If your organization restricts to wildcard subdomains (e.g., `*.dell.com`), you can filter the results by using the following `grep` command to extract only the allowed subdomains:
  
    ```bash
    grep -a "\.dell.com$"
    ```
